![Stock Sentiment](Images/sentimental.jpeg)

## Background

in this repository, I used natural language processing to decipher the emotion in recent news stories about Bitcoin and Ethereum. I also applied  NLP techniques to better understand the other aspects that influence coin pricing, such as common terms and phrases, as well as the businesses and entities mentioned in the articles.

Completed tasks:
1. [Sentiment Analysis](#1---Sentiment-Analysis)
2. [Natural Language Processing](#2---Natural-Language-Processing)
3. [Named Entity Recognition](#3---Named-Entity-Recognition)
